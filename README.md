# 👋 Hi, I’m Govind

Flutter developer focused on **production-grade applications**, not demos.

I work at the intersection of Flutter and native Android when real-world constraints demand it — offline usage, background execution, hardware integration, and system-level restrictions.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Flutter apps for **healthcare and enterprise** environments
- Offline-first architecture with reliable sync strategies
- Background services, kiosk-mode flows, and device-level integrations
- Custom Flutter plugins using **Kotlin** when platform channels aren’t optional

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Open to Collaborating On
- Flutter plugins (platform channels, background services, hardware access)
- Open-source tools that solve **real production problems**
- Architecture-heavy Flutter projects where maintainability actually matters

---

## 🤝 Looking for Help With
- Deep Android system APIs (device owner, background limits, OEM restrictions)
- Scaling Flutter apps without turning them into untestable messes
- Improving testability and long-term stability in large codebases

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Advanced **Riverpod** patterns and state orchestration
- Android internals: services, permissions, and system constraints
- On-device ML in Flutter (TFLite, inference pipelines)

---

## 💬 Ask Me About
- Flutter in real production environments (not tutorial examples)
- State management trade-offs: Riverpod vs GetX vs Bloc — with reasoning
- Offline sync, background execution, and persistence strategies
- Printing, kiosks, and Android device restrictions
